The process of sending DHT11 sensor data to a Google Sheet involves the following steps:

Connect the DHT11 sensor to a microcontroller like Arduino or NodeMCU and upload the appropriate code to read the sensor data.

Create a Google Sheet and enable the "Google Sheets API" on the Google Cloud Console.

Generate API credentials for accessing the Google Sheets API and save them in a secure location.

Install the "Google Sheets API" library in your microcontroller's programming environment.

Write code to push the DHT11 sensor data to the Google Sheet using the "Google Sheets API" library.

Test the code to ensure that the DHT11 sensor data is being correctly sent to the Google Sheet.

Once the test is successful, you can use the data in the Google Sheet for further analysis or visualization.

Overall, this process requires some programming knowledge and experience with microcontrollers, but it is a straightforward way to send DHT11 sensor data to a Google Sheet in real-time.
